This has the code for MDS projection based on FGW distance showing filamentary structure and Intrinsic dimension distribution via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

The MDS projection reveals that the MUTAG graph dataset does not form a single smooth manifold, but instead breaks into thin, filament-like structures separated by large regions of empty space.
At the same time, intrinsic dimension analysis shows that graph variation is locally low-dimensional (≈4), indicating consistent local degrees of freedom despite global fragmentation and singularities.
